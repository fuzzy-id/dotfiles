* Fuzzy_ID's configuration

So, when starting to use git we see its usefulness and start to throw
everything at first in a git repo. And so it happened with my
configuration files.

** My setup

I use 
+ xmonad as window manager,
+ xmobar as a small and light-weight status bar, with a trayer in it,
+ gmrun launches applications,
+ zsh as a shell,
+ unicode-rxvt as x terminal emulator,
+ the Neo layout[fn:1] as keyboard layout.

I don't use a graphical log in manager, but rather log in via the
console and manually do a ~startx~. This is important, as this way
+ ~/.zprofile and
+ ~/.xinitrc 
are evaluated. Which do the setup of the above setup.

I use Conkeror[fn:2] for web browsing and Emacs for everything
else. :) Anyway, my Emacs configuration is a bit more complicated, so
I keep it in a separate git repo and do only a load in my ~.emacs~
